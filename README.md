Jobs that keep the lights on and the shards a comin'

## Job Definitions

 - *SluggaFarmer.ps1* some basic tools for working with the API
 - *ShardLeaderboard.ps1* self-explanatory.  shows the shard leaders.  doesn't include everyone, just top 25 wallets.
 - *RefreshLocalState.ps1* Download the Slugga state as JSON and store it in `c:\temp\_slugga`
 - *MatrixMinder.ps1* look through the local cache and decide the correct next move for each.  Sleep, Feed, Pet, Do Nothing. 
 - *BruteForceFarming.ps1* This is the opposite approach from Matrix Minder.  straight ahead, every slugga does every step in the same order.
